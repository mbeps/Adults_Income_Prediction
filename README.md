# **Adult Income Prediction**

This project focuses on comparing various classifications algorithms on the [Adult Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/adult/desc.html). 
The primary goal is to determine if a person earns `<=50K` or `>50K` annually.

This repository provides insights into our methodology, results, and the importance of each feature in influencing the prediction. 

Dive in to explore the nuances of income prediction and the factors that influence it!

# **Running Notebook Locally**
These are simple steps to run the notebook locally. 
Jupyter is required.

## 1. **Clone the Project Locally**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mbeps/House_Price_Prediction.git
```

## 2. **Set Up Environment**

### Using Anaconda (Preferred)
If you have Anaconda installed, create a new environment and activate it. Once active, install the required packages.

### Using Poetry (Alternative for non-Anaconda users)
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed.
2. If you are using Poetry and do not have Anaconda, install the dependencies:
```sh
poetry install
```

## 3. **Run the Project**
After setting up the environment and installing all dependencies, navigate to the project's root directory and run the main notebook. 

> Note: Adjust the specific steps, commands, or any other requirements based on the nature of your project or any additional configurations that might be needed.
